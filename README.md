## Description

Are you tired of spending countless hours searching for the best flight tickets? Look no further! The Flight Tickets Comparison app makes your life easier by comparing flight tickets for you!

Using the Amadeus API, this React application allows you to search for flights by specifying your current location, destination, date, and time. It then retrieves flight data and compares the obtained flight tickets with the specified time to find the best ticket. And the best part? It provides error messages in case of incorrect data or no tickets found.
